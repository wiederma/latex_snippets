  abstract="Cache attacks, which exploit differences in timing to perform covert or side channels, are now well understood. Recent works leverage the last level cache to perform cache attacks across cores. This cache is split in slices, with one slice per core. While predicting the slices used by an address is simple in older processors, recent processors are using an undocumented technique called complex addressing. This renders some attacks more difficult and makes other attacks impossible, because of the loss of precision in the prediction of cache collisions.",
